Version 0.3 August 2005
==========================

- fixed bug where a deleted displayed equation would result in math mode commands 
  being processed in text mode (the "! Missing $ inserted" error). 
 
- Improved parsing in math mode: Superscript and subscript and \left,\right are now parsed correctly

- shell script for providing CVS support

Minor:

- fixed a bug in utf8 mode that resulted in many warning messages and
  failure to parse properly words with national characters

- Now works with the latest version of Algorithm::Diff (version 1.19)

- new options "--allow-spaces" and "--ignore-warnings"

- Better wording and enhanced context for warning messages 

- '|' character is now recognised as valid math mode character

- Fixed a bug whereby \begin{document} and \end{document} in comments are nevertheless treated as real begin and end points

- add \protect in front of \nogroupcolor command in DVIPSCOL subtype (old version broke sometimes according to bug reports although I could not replicate the problem)

- replace \uline by \uwave in CUNDERLINE style, such that added and deleted text parts look different even in math mode

- Markup within DIFnomarkup enviroment is removed by latexdiff. This can be used to protect parts
  for which latexdiff has trouble creating proper latex code. 

- no markup type FONTSTRIKE


Version 0.2  September 2004
===========================

- introduced subtype DVIPSCOL (coloring changed blocks for dvips converter)

- support for utf8 and other encodings 

Minor:

- removed buggy COLOR subtype

- Usage information no longer printed automatically after certain syntactic error messages

- short options -a, -A, -x, -X now really do what is claimed in the manual

- bug in failback splitting of input was fixed

- options --exclude-textcmd, --append-textcmd, --exclude-safecmd, and --append-safecmd
  can now take comma-separated list as well as a file as argument.
