INTRODUCTION

latexdiff is a Perl script, which compares two latex files and marks
up significant differences between them (i.e. a diff for latex files).
  Various options are available for visual markup using standard latex 
packages such as "color.sty". Changes not directly affecting visible 
text, for example in formatting commands, are still marked in 
the latex source.
 
A rudimentary revision facilility is provided by another Perl script,
latexrevise, which accepts or rejects all changes.  Manual
editing of the difference file can be used to override this default
behaviour and accept or reject selected changes only.  

REQUIREMENTS

Perl 5.6 or higher must be installed (5.8 if different encodings are used).
  The latexdiff script makes use of the Perl package Algorithm::Diff (available 
from www.cpan.org, current version 1.19). You can either install this package, or
use the standalone version of latexdiff, latexdiff-so, which has version 1.15 of 
this package inlined and does not require external installation of
the package. Because latexdiff uses internal functions of Algorithm:Diff whose 
calling format or availability can change without notice, the preferred method is
now to use the standalone version.

For those with very dated perl installations, the stand-alone obsolete 
version 0.1 of latexdiff is provided as latexdiff-0.1.  It is possible 
that in some very special cases latexdiff-0.2 yields better results 
than the current version, so in order to assure reproducability I provide
this version, too, as latexdiff-0.2.  However, these obsolete versions should be 
avoided if possible, and are no longer supported.

INSTALLATION UNIX/LINUX

The basic installation procedure is almost trivial:

1. Copy latexdiff and latexrevise into a directory which is in the
   search path and make them executable.  If the Algorithm::Diff
   package is not installed, use latexdiff-so instead of latexdiff.

2. Copy latexdiff.1 and latexrevise.1 into the correct man directory

The attached Makefile contains example commands to carry out above 
steps as root for a typical UNIX installation. Type 

  make install          (for the stand alone version)
or
  make install-ext      (for the version using the external Algorithm::Diff)

to get it rolling.  You can type

  make test
or
  make test-ext

to test both versions on a brief example before installation
